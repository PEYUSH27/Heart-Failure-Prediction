# Heart-Failure-Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a Random Forest Classifier.
It involves data cleaning, encoding, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Visualizations include a correlation heatmap and feature importance plot.
Built in Python (scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) on Google Colab.
